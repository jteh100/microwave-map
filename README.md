# Microwave Map
This is a simple Java program created during WICS Hackathon 2024. It is the first edition of a project called My Campus Buddy, an application designed to provide UT students with the closest location of any service they need on campus. This edition provides the location of the nearest microwave on campus. 

How to use:
1. Download the files MicrowaveMap.java and microwaves.txt, ensuring that they are downloaded to the same location.
2. Run MicrowaveMap.java.
3. The console will prompt you for the abbreviation of the building you are currently in. Type in the abbreviation and press Enter.
4. The program will print the building with the nearest microwave to the console!

Future improvements to be made:
- Adding location of microwaves within each building
- Expanding to other services such as outdoor charging stations, bike racks, gender-inclusive bathrooms, and printers
- Converting program to a mobile application
